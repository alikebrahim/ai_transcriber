# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Strategy

### Commit Guidelines
- Do not include Claude signature in commits
- Include details of work done with reasonable brevity
- Focus on the "why" rather than just the "what"
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose

### Commit Message Format
- Start with a concise summary of changes
- Follow with brief explanation of motivation/impact
- Use present tense ("fix" not "fixed")
- Avoid generic words without context

### Example Good Commit Messages
- "Fix Google AI model API compatibility and prevent directory creation on failure"
- "Add input validation to prevent empty project creation"
- "Update transcription format to improve readability"

### Example Bad Commit Messages
- "Update files"
- "Fix bug"
- "Changes"
